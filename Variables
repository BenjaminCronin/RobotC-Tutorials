//This code will not compile, so don't try it
//It's meant to show the basics of variable usage

/* Variable Types
int-any integer up to a certain size (very large, I think ~ 2,000,000,000), but you don't need to worry about that
float-any decimal to 7 places, I'm not sure what the limit is on overall size

float and int are same size, so if you aren't sure which to use, and it's not supposed to be a massive number, use a float for precision

char-a single character, can be anything (I think) including numbers up to a certain size

bool-true or false, very useful

string-a series of letters and numbers

when assigning a value to a string, put the text into "quotation marks"

when assigning a value to a char, put the character into 'apostrophes'

word-basically a bool, but used with the joystick buttons

There are other RobotC-specific variable types, but they aren't all that useful

//declaring a variable
typeName varName;

//declaring an int
int foo;

//assigning a value to a variable
varName = val;

//assigning the value 10 to an int
foo = 10;

/*variable operators
    = assign value
    int and float
    + add values
    - subtract values
    * multiply values
    / divide values
foo = val1 + val2;
foo = val1 - val2;
foo = val1 * val2;
foo = val1 / val2;

to do something with a value and the current value

foo += val;
is the same as foo = foo + val;

same goes for other operations
foo -= val;
foo /= val;
foo *= val;*/
